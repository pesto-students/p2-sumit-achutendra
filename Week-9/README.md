Create React App

Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

To create a project, run:

npx create-react-app todo-list-app       // in the Terminal

To enter the folder-
cd todo-list-app

npm start

With the start argument, NPM will begin the process to make a development server available for your React application.


todo list is app just like google keep app use store/keep your todo tasks the to want to
remember and keep track of.
it has a input field to add new todo tasks to the list and if the tasks is done mark it as done.
